// Fixed restore (#407), the apply half: decide BEFORE the pipeline runs which expanded originals
// this turn restores at their anchors, so every offloader replays its compaction of them instead of
// honouring kept-verbatim (components.Ctx.Restored), then insert the restored copies into the body
// the pipeline produced. See expand/anchor.go for the mechanism and why it exists.
//
// The decision is all-or-nothing PER ANCHOR, and made up front, because the two halves must agree:
// an original kept compacted with no copy inserted is content the model cannot see, and a copy
// inserted next to an un-compacted original is the duplication #201 removed. Every reason an anchor
// cannot be honoured — no record, the stash gone, the transcript no longer matching — drops it from
// the plan before Ctx.Restored is built, and that original is kept verbatim in place exactly as
// before.

// restoreItem is one anchor this turn honours, with the original it restores.
