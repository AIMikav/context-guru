// dedupNote is what the model reads in place of the duplicated output.
//
// It says THIS IS A POINTER and, where the transcript can prove it, WHICH CALL the
// original came from. Both halves are load-bearing, and #281 is what happens without
// them: an agent that had just edited a file, re-ran the same inspection command and
// got a dedup marker back could not tell "your edit changed nothing, here is proof"
// from "this is a caching artifact, unrelated to your edit" — the one moment the
// equivalence claim is being relied on for signal rather than for token savings. It
// spent extra turns re-reading from disk to establish what the marker already knew.
//
// Naming the command is the recoverable half of that. "an earlier tool output" asserts an
// equivalence the model cannot check; "repeat of earlier `python -c ...`" is a claim it can
// locate, compare against its own expectations, and disbelieve — and disbelieving is the
// point, because only the model can initiate recovery via the expand tool. The note
// therefore states WHAT was removed and never why it was safe to remove, the rule coref.go
// arrived at the hard way: wording that reassures talks the model out of the expand call
// that would have repaired a mistake.
//
// WHY NOT THE TURN INDEX, which is what #281 actually suggested. "identical to the
// output at step N" is position-dependent, and dedup's replacement bytes must be a pure
// function of content: it is one of the offloaders Ctx.CacheAware explicitly exempts
// from the cache-tail gate on the grounds that it "is already byte-stable on the
// unchanged prefix" (components/component.go). The transcript grows every turn, so a
// marker carrying the first copy's index would rewrite itself inside the provider's
// cached prefix as messages accumulate, forcing a full-suffix cache write at ~12x the
// read price — paying a large, recurring bill for a reference the model cannot resolve
// anyway (it sees no message indices). The producing command is derived from content
// that is already in the prefix ahead of this message, so it is stable across turns.
// state.go's note on the "xdedup index" reaches the same conclusion from the other side.
//
// The shape is one bracket that CLOSES around the marker — "[repeat of earlier `cmd`;
// expand <<cg:HASH>>]" — so the pointer reads as a single clause and the expand cue costs
// three tokens instead of the ten a separate "[full output: call context_guru_expand]"
// trailer costs. The tool's full name is not repeated: expand.Inject puts its definition
// in `tools` on every turn that carries a marker, with a description keyed to the
// <<cg:HASH>> form, so the name is already in front of the model and the word "expand"
// next to the marker is enough to point at it.

// a pathological Write payload cannot turn the pointer into something bigger than the

// stay verbatim, which is a silent loss of the saving rather than a bug).
// The cap is in TOKENS, not bytes, because bytes are not what anything here is paid in
// and the two diverge badly on exactly the input that needs bounding. A 60-BYTE cap let
// `some/long/path/some/long/path/…` through at 44 tokens: dense punctuation tokenizes at
// roughly one token every one or two bytes, while ordinary prose and paths run three to
// four, so a byte cap is loosest precisely where the command is least informative. Capping
// on schema.TextTokens — the same counter tryMark's never-worse guard uses — bounds the
// thing the guard actually compares.
//
// It bounds the COMMAND; the backticks and ellipsis around it add two or three more, and
// the note's fixed words add the rest. TestTheDedupPointerStaysWithinItsTokenBudget is
// what holds the assembled pointer to a figure, which is the number that actually matters.

	// 100 KB command hang outright. No text survives the token cap past maxCmdTokens*4
